# commaai_speed-challenge
My take on the comma ai speed challenge 2020

Use the preprocessor.py to set up the training data. Use the training.py to train the data and generate weights. 
Finally use the predict.py to check the output and MSE.

To generate test output, use postprocessor.py and then use predict2.py to get final output.
